# QuiziCool
Quiz site created for CSCI 366 Database Systems Project

To build the site, first enter the QuiziCool angular project directory in the terminal and run "ng build --prod". This should create a production version of the project in a dist folder on your computer.

Move the contents of the dist folder to the host site you're running on.

The host site is currently set to run on "http://students.cs.ndsu.nodak.edu/~wyandrew/Database_Systems/QuiziCool/". If you would like to build to a different site, then enter the src < index.html file and readjust the href element in the base tag before running ng build.
